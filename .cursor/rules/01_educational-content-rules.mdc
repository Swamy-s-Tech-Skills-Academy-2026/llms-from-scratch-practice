# Project Rules for LLMs From Scratch Practice

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: January 22, 2026  
**Priority**: MANDATORY

---

## 📋 Core Principles

### Zero-Copy Policy
- All code must be original and properly customized for this project
- No copy-paste artifacts from other projects
- Ensure all references and naming match this project
- Content must be transformative, not reformative
- Even quotes and key principles must use original phrasing
- Learning exercises should be independent re-implementations, not direct copies
- **Source Material Workflow**: Read from `source-material/`, synthesize in your own words, publish to educational folders
- **Never copy-paste** from `source-material/` - it's a staging area for reference only
- See `08_source-material-rules.mdc` for detailed source material handling guidelines

### Code Quality
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guide, use type hints where appropriate, include comprehensive docstrings
- **Meaningful Variable Names**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `token_embeddings` instead of `te`, `attention_weights` instead of `aw`)
- **Comments Philosophy**: 
  - Explain the **conceptual reason** for the operation (e.g., "We normalize here to prevent gradient explosion")
  - Explain the **mathematical mapping** (e.g., "`mu` represents the population mean in this distribution")
  - Avoid just syntax explanation (e.g., don't write "This creates a list")
- **No Hardcoded Paths**: Use `pathlib` or relative paths
- Prioritize clarity and explainability over performance (educational focus)
- Keep logic explicit and inspectable (avoid heavy abstractions)
- Maintain modular structure as project grows

### Educational Focus
- This is a learning workspace, not a production deployment
- Code clarity is prioritized over raw performance
- Every major component should be explainable
- Document the "why" behind implementation choices

### Academic Integrity (Zero-Copy)
- **Original Synthesis**: Do not copy-paste directly from textbooks or source material
- **Citation**: If referencing a specific definition, theorem, or concept, cite the source
- **Review Strictness**: Reviewers must reject content that appears to be direct copies or close paraphrases
- **Concept First**: Explain the concept in Markdown before writing code
- **Math Notation**: Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions in notebooks (e.g., $P(x|y) = \frac{P(y|x)P(x)}{P(y)}$)

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features
1. Maintain modular structure (tokenization, model, training, evaluation)
2. Add comprehensive docstrings explaining concepts
3. Write unit tests for core functionality
4. Update documentation in docs/ directory
5. Keep implementations inspectable and educational

### File Naming
- **Python**: Use lowercase with underscores: `tokenizer.py`, `attention.py`, `gpt.py`
- Keep names descriptive and clear
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Organize by domain (tokenization/, model/, training/, evaluation/)

### Error Handling
- Use proper exception handling
- Log errors with context
- Provide clear error messages for learning purposes
- Validate inputs appropriately

---

## 📝 Documentation Standards

- Keep README.md accurate and up-to-date
- Document all configuration options
- Maintain usage guides in docs/ directory
- Update technical documentation when code changes
- Include learning objectives and checkpoints
- Document mathematical concepts and trade-offs

## 🎓 Learning Tone & Voice (Swamy's Style)

All notebooks and learning notes should use **Swamy's personal learning tone**:

### First-Person Voice
- Use "I'm learning...", "I'm revising...", "I want to be able to..."
- Write as personal notes, not formal instruction
- Example: "I'm building intuition for attention by working through this example"

### Reflection-Oriented
- Include intent, confusion, or takeaways
- Use phrases like "I noticed...", "I still need to...", "My takeaway:..."
- Acknowledge gaps or areas needing more practice
- Example: "I noticed I confuse embeddings with encodings, so I'm writing this down"

### Personal Journey, Not Instruction
- Prefer "my notes", "my understanding", "my revision"
- Avoid lecturer/course framing: never say "this course" or "the instructor"
- Write as if documenting your own learning process
- Example: "My understanding: tokenization splits text, but I need to practice BPE more"

### Style Guidelines
- **Keep it concise and honest**: Acknowledge what you don't know yet
- **Use simple, clear language**: Avoid formal teaching tone
- **Show learning process**: Include confusion, realizations, and next steps
- **Be authentic**: Write as you're actually learning, not teaching

### Example Phrasing
- ✅ "I'm building intuition for self-attention by implementing it step-by-step"
- ✅ "I noticed I mix up query and key roles, so I'm clarifying this here"
- ✅ "My takeaway: layer normalization stabilizes training, but I need to understand why"
- ✅ "I still need to practice backpropagation through attention - adding this to my revision list"
- ❌ "This course teaches attention mechanisms" (too formal, lecturer tone)
- ❌ "The instructor explains that..." (course framing)
- ❌ "We will learn about..." (instructional, not personal)
