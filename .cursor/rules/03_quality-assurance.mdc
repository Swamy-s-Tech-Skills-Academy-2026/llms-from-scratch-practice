# Quality Assurance

## Code Quality Checklist

### Python Scripts (`src/`)
- [ ] Follows PEP 8 style guide
- [ ] Type hints used for function arguments and return types
- [ ] Docstrings included for all functions and classes
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (use `pathlib` or relative paths)
- [ ] All imports properly organized (stdlib → third-party → local)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No linting errors (flake8, pylint)

### Jupyter Notebooks (`notebooks/`)
- [ ] **Kernel Restart & Run All** passes without errors
- [ ] Logical flow: Import → Load Data → Process → Analyze → Visualize → Conclusion
- [ ] No hidden state (variables defined in deleted cells)
- [ ] Markdown cells clearly explain the steps and concepts
- [ ] Visualizations have titles, labels, and legends
- [ ] All cells run sequentially without errors
- [ ] Reproducibility: Set random seeds where applicable (`np.random.seed(42)`, `torch.manual_seed(42)`)

## Testing Requirements

- All modules must have unit tests
- Test coverage should be comprehensive
- Run tests before committing: `uv run pytest`
- Notebooks should be tested by running "Restart Kernel & Run All"

## Data Validation (When Working with Datasets)

- [ ] Check for missing values in datasets
- [ ] Verify data types and shapes are as expected
- [ ] Validate tokenization outputs (no empty tokens, proper encoding)
- [ ] Ensure data preprocessing is reproducible

## Content Review Checklist (Zero-Copy)

- [ ] **Originality Check**: Verify that text is not a direct copy from source material
- [ ] **Synthesis**: Ensure content represents a synthesized understanding, not just rephrasing
- [ ] **Citations**: Check that definitions and specific claims are cited when referencing sources

## Documentation Quality

- README.md must match actual implementation
- Usage guides must be accurate
- Code comments explain complex logic and concepts
- Configuration options documented
- Mathematical formulas correctly formatted (LaTeX in notebooks)
