# Cursor Rules (STSA 2026)

This repository is a **learning workspace** for building a GPT-style LLM from scratch.
Please follow these guidelines when generating or modifying code and docs:

- **Educational first**: Prioritize clarity, correctness, and explainability over performance.
- **From scratch mindset**: Avoid heavy abstractions; keep logic explicit and inspectable.
- **Small, focused changes**: Make minimal edits that are easy to review.
- **Document intent**: Update docs when structure, behavior, or learning flow changes.
- **Avoid production framing**: This is not a deployment-ready repo.
- **Respect attribution**: Keep references to the book where appropriate.
- **Simple stack**: Prefer plain Python and PyTorch fundamentals.
