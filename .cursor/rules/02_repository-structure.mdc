# Repository Structure

**Project**: LLMs From Scratch Practice (STSA 2026)

> **📖 Single Source of Truth**: For complete and up-to-date repository structure, see [docs/01_repository-structure.md](../../docs/01_repository-structure.md)

## Quick Reference

**Key Directories:**
- `src/` - Core implementation code (Python modules)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning
- `docs/` - Study notes and planning documentation
  - `docs/reviews/` - **All review reports MUST go here**
  - `docs/reference/` - Reference materials (git, PowerShell, Python commands)
  - `docs/reading-notes/` - Synthesized study notes and summaries
- `source-material/` - **READ-ONLY** staging area for raw author content (transcripts, PDFs, scratch notes)
- `tests/` - Unit tests (to be created)

**Key Entry Points:**
- `src/main.py` - Main entry point
- `notebooks/ch02/01_ch02.ipynb` - Chapter 2 learning notebook
- `pyproject.toml` - Project dependencies (uv)

**Planned Structure** (as project grows):
- `src/tokenization/` - Tokenizer implementations
- `src/model/` - GPT/Transformer architecture
- `src/training/` - Training loops and optimization
- `src/evaluation/` - Metrics and analysis

## Documentation Location Standards

**CRITICAL**: All review reports, notebook reviews, and fix summaries MUST be created in `docs/reviews/`:
- ✅ `docs/reviews/REVIEW_REPORT_2026-01-22.md`
- ✅ `docs/reviews/FIXES_SUMMARY_2026-01-22.md`
- ✅ `docs/reviews/NOTEBOOK_ZERO_COPY_FIXES.md`
- ❌ Never create review docs in root directory
- ❌ Never create review docs in `docs/` directly

## Source Material Standards

**CRITICAL**: The `source-material/` folder is READ-ONLY and serves as a staging area:
- ✅ Read from `source-material/` to understand concepts
- ✅ Synthesize content in your own words
- ✅ Publish synthesized content to `notebooks/`, `docs/reading-notes/`, or `docs/`
- ❌ NEVER modify, overwrite, or delete files in `source-material/`
- ❌ NEVER copy-paste directly from `source-material/`
- See `08_source-material-rules.mdc` for complete guidelines
