# Markdown Standards

## Documentation Files

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Use H2 (`##`) for main topics, H3 (`###`) for subtopics
- Include code fence language specifications
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Keep line length reasonable (~120 chars)
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for definitions or key takeaways
- Use tables for summarizing properties or comparisons

## Code Examples

- Always specify language in code fences: ` ```python `
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Show complete, runnable examples when possible
- Comment liberally to explain concepts (e.g., `mu` represents population mean)

## Mathematical Notation

- Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions in notebooks
- Inline math: `$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$`
- Display math: `$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$`
- Ensure formulas are correctly formatted

## File References

- Use relative paths for internal references
- Verify all file references point to existing files
- Update references when files are moved/renamed

## Learning Tone (Notebooks & Notes)

When writing markdown cells in notebooks or study notes:
- Use **first-person voice**: "I'm learning...", "I noticed...", "My takeaway..."
- Be **reflection-oriented**: Include intent, confusion, or realizations
- Write as **personal journey**: "my notes", "my understanding", not formal instruction
- **Avoid lecturer tone**: Never say "this course" or "the instructor"
- Keep it **concise and honest**: Acknowledge gaps or next steps
- Use **simple, clear language**: Avoid formal teaching tone
