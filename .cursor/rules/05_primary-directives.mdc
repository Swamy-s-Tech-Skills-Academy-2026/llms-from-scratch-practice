# Primary Directives

## Project Focus

This is an **educational learning workspace** for building a GPT-style Large Language Model from scratch that:
- Implements tokenization (BPE, vocabulary handling)
- Builds transformer architecture (attention, feedforward, GPT blocks)
- Trains models using PyTorch
- Evaluates model performance and generates text
- Focuses on deep conceptual understanding, not production deployment

## Current State

- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ Dependencies configured (pyproject.toml with uv)
- ✅ Basic source code structure in place
- ✅ Chapter 2 notebook started (tokenization)
- ⏳ Model architecture implementation (in progress)
- ⏳ Training loop implementation (planned)
- ⏳ Evaluation and generation (planned)

## Documentation Accuracy

- Documentation must accurately reflect the learning objectives
- Code examples must be runnable and educational
- Mathematical concepts should be clearly explained
- No misleading technology descriptions
- Learning checkpoints should be documented

## Code Maintenance

- Maintain modular structure (tokenization, model, training, evaluation)
- Keep code clear and inspectable (educational priority)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Document the "why" behind implementation choices
- Prioritize clarity over performance optimizations
