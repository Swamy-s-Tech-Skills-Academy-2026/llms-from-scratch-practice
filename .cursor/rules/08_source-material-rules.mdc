# Source Material Rules

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: January 22, 2026  
**Priority**: MANDATORY

---

## 📚 Purpose

The `source-material/` folder is a **staging area** for raw author content, reference materials, and original sources. This includes:
- Book transcripts and excerpts
- PDF extracts
- Scratch notes from reading
- Original code examples from references
- Any raw content that needs to be synthesized

---

## 🚫 Critical Restrictions

### Read-Only Policy
- **NEVER modify** any file inside `source-material/`
- **NEVER overwrite** any file inside `source-material/`
- **NEVER edit** content in `source-material/` even if it contains errors
- Files in `source-material/` are **permanent reference materials**

### No Deletion Policy
- **NEVER delete** anything from `source-material/`
- Content remains in `source-material/` even after migration
- It serves as a permanent historical reference
- Deletion is **strictly forbidden**

---

## 🔄 Migration Workflow

When working with content from `source-material/`, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Read from Source
- Read and understand the content in `source-material/`
- Study the concepts, examples, and explanations
- Take notes on key ideas

### Step 2: Synthesize (Write in Your Own Words)
- **DO NOT copy-paste** from `source-material/`
- Rewrite concepts using your own phrasing
- Transform the content, don't reform it
- Explain concepts from your own understanding

### Step 3: Publish to Educational Folders
- Create content in appropriate educational folders:
  - `notebooks/` - Interactive learning notebooks
  - `docs/reading-notes/` - Study notes and summaries
  - `docs/` - General documentation
  - `src/` - Implementation code
- Ensure published content is original and synthesized

### Step 4: Add Citations
- When relying on specific definitions, theorems, or concepts
- Add proper citations to the original source
- Use format: `[Reference: Book Title, Author, Chapter/Section]`
- Include page numbers or section references when applicable

## 🔄 Workflow Trigger

When the user asks to "bring content from Author" or "migrate from source-material" or similar:
1. Look for the file in `source-material/`
2. Read the content thoroughly
3. Draft the new content in the appropriate educational folder (`notebooks/`, `docs/reading-notes/`, etc.)
4. Ensure the new content is an original synthesis, not a copy-paste

---

## ✅ Zero-Copy Policy Application

The zero-copy policy applies **both during creation and during review**:

### During Creation
- Read from `source-material/` to understand concepts
- Write your own explanations and implementations
- Use original phrasing, not copied text
- Transform ideas into your own learning materials

### During Review
- Reject content that looks like direct copying
- Reject content that is close paraphrase
- Flag any text that appears copied from `source-material/`
- Ensure all content is synthesized and original

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
source-material/
├── book-excerpts/          # Extracts from reference books
├── transcripts/            # Transcripts of lectures or videos
├── pdf-extracts/          # Extracted content from PDFs
├── scratch-notes/         # Raw notes from reading sessions
├── reference-code/        # Original code examples (for reference only)
└── README.md              # Explanation of source-material purpose
```

---

## 🎯 Examples

### ✅ CORRECT Workflow

1. Read `source-material/book-excerpts/ch02-tokenization.txt`
2. Understand the concept of tokenization
3. Write your own explanation in `notebooks/ch02/01_ch02.ipynb`:
   ```markdown
   ## Tokenization
   
   Tokenization involves splitting text into discrete units that can be 
   processed by language models. These units become the basic building blocks...
   ```
4. Add citation: `[Reference: Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch), Raschka, Chapter 2]`

### ❌ INCORRECT Workflow

1. Copy text directly from `source-material/book-excerpts/ch02-tokenization.txt`
2. Paste into `notebooks/ch02/01_ch02.ipynb`
3. This violates zero-copy policy

---

## 🔍 Review Checklist

When reviewing content, check:
- [ ] No direct copy-paste from `source-material/`
- [ ] Content uses original phrasing
- [ ] Concepts are explained in own words
- [ ] Citations are included when referencing specific sources
- [ ] Content is transformative, not reformative
- [ ] `source-material/` files remain untouched

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- `source-material/` is for **reference only**, not for direct use
- All published content must be **synthesized and original**
- The folder serves as a **permanent archive** of source materials
- Never treat `source-material/` as a working directory
- Always maintain clear separation between source and synthesized content
