# Cursor Rules for LLMs From Scratch Practice

## Documentation Location Standards

**CRITICAL**: All review reports, notebook reviews, and fix summaries MUST be created in `docs/reviews/`:
- ✅ `docs/reviews/REVIEW_REPORT_*.md`
- ✅ `docs/reviews/FIXES_SUMMARY_*.md`
- ✅ `docs/reviews/NOTEBOOK_*.md`
- ❌ Never create review docs in root directory
- ❌ Never create review docs directly in `docs/`

## Project Context

This is a **learning workspace** for building a GPT-style LLM from scratch based on the book "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)".

### Core Principles
- **Educational first**: Prioritize clarity, correctness, and explainability over performance
- **From scratch mindset**: Avoid heavy abstractions; keep logic explicit and inspectable
- **Small, focused changes**: Make minimal edits that are easy to review
- **Document intent**: Update docs when structure, behavior, or learning flow changes
- **Zero-copy policy**: Always check for local files before downloading from external sources

### Directory Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks organized by chapter
- `src/` - Python source modules
- `docs/` - Documentation
  - `docs/reviews/` - All review reports
  - `docs/reference/` - Reference materials
- `tests/` - Unit tests (to be created)

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.13+
- PyTorch
- tiktoken
- Jupyter notebooks
- uv for dependency management
