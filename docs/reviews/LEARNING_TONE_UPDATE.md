## Key Guidelines Established

### First-Person Voice
- ✅ "I'm learning...", "I'm revising...", "I want to be able to..."
- ❌ "We will learn...", "This teaches..."

### Reflection-Oriented
- ✅ "I noticed...", "I still need to...", "My takeaway:..."
- ✅ Include intent, confusion, or realizations
- ✅ Acknowledge gaps or areas needing practice

### Personal Journey, Not Instruction
- ✅ "my notes", "my understanding", "my revision"
- ❌ "this course", "the instructor", "we will learn"

### Style Principles
- Concise and honest
- Simple, clear language
- Show learning process (confusion, realizations, next steps)
- Authentic voice (learning, not teaching)

---

## Example Phrasing

### ✅ Good Examples
- "I'm building intuition for self-attention by implementing it step-by-step"
- "I noticed I mix up query and key roles, so I'm clarifying this here"
- "My takeaway: layer normalization stabilizes training, but I need to understand why"
- "I still need to practice backpropagation through attention - adding this to my revision list"

### ❌ Bad Examples
- "This course teaches attention mechanisms" (too formal, lecturer tone)
- "The instructor explains that..." (course framing)
- "We will learn about..." (instructional, not personal)
