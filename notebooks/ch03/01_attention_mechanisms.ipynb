    "# My Learning Journey: Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date**: January 27, 2026  \n",
    "**Learning Goal**: Build the Self-Attention mechanism from scratch using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I'm Learning Today\n",
    "\n",
    "I am moving into the heart of the Transformer architecture: **Attention**.\n",
    "My goal is to understand how the model relates different words in a sequence to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Understanding So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embeddings** (Ch 2) turn tokens into fixed-size vectors.\n",
    "- However, embeddings are static—the embedding for \"bank\" is the same in \"river bank\" and \"bank account\".\n",
    "- **Attention** allows the model to contextually update these representations based on surrounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Simple Self-Attention**: Using loops (slow but clear).\n",
    "2.  **Matrix Multiplication**: Vectorizing the operation (fast).\n",
    "3.  **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Adding the scaling factor $1/\\sqrt{d_k}$.\n",
    "4.  **Causal Attention**: Masking future tokens (crucial for GPT).\n",
    "5.  **Multi-Head Attention**: Running multiple attention mechanisms in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts derived from *Build a Large Language Model From Scratch* (Raschka).  \n",
    "Implementation is my own reconstruction to build intuition."
