    "# My Learning Journey: Understanding Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)\n",

    "**Date**: January 27, 2026  \n",
    "**Learning Goal**: I'm deepening my understanding of how BPE tokenization works by exploring different implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I'm Learning Today\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm revisiting Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which is the tokenization method used in GPT-2 and many other LLMs. I want to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why BPE exists** - What problem does it solve compared to simple word splitting?\n",
    "2. **How different libraries implement BPE** - tiktoken, transformers, and the original OpenAI code\n",
    "3. **Performance differences** - Which implementation is fastest and why?\n",
    "4. **Practical usage** - How do I actually use these tokenizers in my code?\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Understanding So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "From Chapter 2, I learned that BPE:\n",
    "- Starts with individual characters as base tokens\n",
    "- Iteratively merges the most frequent pair of adjacent tokens\n",
    "- Builds up a vocabulary of subword units\n",
    "- Balances between character-level (flexible but long sequences) and word-level (fixed vocab, OOV issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "**I still need to clarify**: How exactly does the merging algorithm decide which pairs to merge? And how does the pre-tokenization step (splitting on whitespace/punctuation) interact with BPE?\n",
    "\n",
