# Copilot Instructions (STSA 2026)

This repository is a **learning workspace** for building a GPT-style LLM from scratch.
Please follow these guidelines when generating or modifying code and docs:

- **Educational first**: Prioritize clarity, correctness, and explainability over performance.
- **From scratch mindset**: Avoid heavy abstractions; keep logic explicit and inspectable.
- **Small, focused changes**: Make minimal edits that are easy to review.
- **Document intent**: Update docs when structure, behavior, or learning flow changes.
- **Avoid production framing**: This is not a deployment-ready repo.
- **Respect attribution**: Keep references to the book where appropriate.
- **Simple stack**: Prefer plain Python and PyTorch fundamentals.

## Documentation Location Standards

- **Review reports**: All code review, notebook review, and fix summary reports MUST be created in `docs/reviews/`
- **Reference materials**: General reference docs (git, PowerShell, Python commands) go in `docs/reference/`
- **Study plans**: Learning roadmaps and study guides go in `docs/`
- **Never create review documentation in the root directory**
